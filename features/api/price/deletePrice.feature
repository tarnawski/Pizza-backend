  @cleanDB
  Scenario: Delete price with id 1 belongs to product with id 1
    Given I set header "Authorization" with value "Bearer OWJkOGQzODliYTZjNTk3YTM1MmY0OTY2NjRlYTk2YmRmM2ZhNGE5YmZmMWVlYTg4MTllMmMxMzg3NzA4NGU5Nw"
    When I send a DELETE request to "/api/products/1/prices/1"
    Then the response code should be 200
    And the JSON response should match:
    """
    {
      "status": "Removed",
      "message": "Price properly removed"
    }
    """
